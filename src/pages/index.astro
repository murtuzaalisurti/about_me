				<p>What I use on a daily basis for software development:</p>
				<div class="category">
					<h4>Editor</h4>
					<p>You guessed it right, it's VSCode! What I love about it is the capability to be simple yet powerful at the same time.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="category">
					<h4>Terminal</h4>
					<p>I use <em>bash</em> inside VSCode's integrated terminal for the most part but I also switch between <a href="https://github.com/vercel/hyper">Hyper</a> and the new Windows Terminal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="category">
					<h4>Themes</h4>
					<p>For my editor, the award goes to <em>One Dark Pro Darker</em> for the most eye-pleasing color pallette.</p>
					<p>For the terminal I went for Oh My Posh's <a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/themes/stelbent.minimal.omp.json">stelbent minimal</a> theme. It's a pretty good theme displaying crucial information.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="category">
					<h4>Fonts</h4>
					<p>Personally I love Apple's SF Mono font, so I found a <a href="https://github.com/epk/SF-Mono-Nerd-Font">nerd font</a> for windows which is the patched SF Mono font.</p>
					<p>JetBrains Mono takes the second place. I was using it for a long time before switching to SF Mono and by far it's the most compact monospace font I have ever used.</p>
