                        You guessed it right, it's VSCode! What I love about it
                        is the capability to be simple yet powerful at the same

                    <p>
                        I use <em>bash</em> inside VSCode's integrated terminal
                        for the most part but I also switch between <a

                        For my editor, the award goes to <em

                    <p>
                        Personally I love Apple's SF Mono font, so I found a <a
                            href="https://github.com/epk/SF-Mono-Nerd-Font"
                            >nerd font</a
                        > for windows which is the patched SF Mono font.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JetBrains Mono takes the second place. I was using it
                        for a long time before switching to SF Mono and by far
                        it's the most compact monospace font I have ever used.
